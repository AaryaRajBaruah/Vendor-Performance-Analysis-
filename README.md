# Vendor Performance Analysis â€“ Retail Inventory & Sales

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing vendor efficiency and profitability in a retail inventory and sales environment. Using **SQL**, **Python**, and **Power BI**, the objective was to uncover cost-saving opportunities, optimize purchasing strategies, and support data-driven decision-making for inventory management.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies Used

- **SQL** â€“ Data extraction, transformation, and aggregation using advanced queries, CTEs, and filtering.
- **Python** â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and insights generation.
- **Power BI** â€“ Dashboard development for data visualization and business intelligence.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Objectives

- Assess vendor performance and profitability.
- Identify underperforming vendors and optimize inventory.
- Provide actionable insights to reduce costs and enhance supply chain efficiency.

## ðŸš€ What I Did

1. **SQL ETL Pipeline**  
   - Developed a complex SQL pipeline to merge and summarize data from multiple tables.  
   - Improved query performance using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and optimized filters for large datasets.

2. **Data Analysis & Hypothesis Testing (Python)**  
   - Conducted EDA and statistical analysis to evaluate:
     - Vendor profitability
     - Inventory turnover
     - Effectiveness of pricing strategies

3. **Power BI Dashboard**  
   - Built interactive dashboards to visualize:
     - Vendor-wise sales and profits
     - Inventory volume and value trends
     - Bulk purchasing impact on cost (identified a **72% cost reduction**)

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

- **65.7%** of purchases were over-dependent on the top 10 vendors.
- Discovered **$2.71M** in unsold inventory from low-performing vendors.
- Recommendation: Diversify vendor selection and optimize purchasing to reduce overstock and improve turnover.
- Actionable dashboards helped stakeholders quickly identify areas of improvement in procurement.
